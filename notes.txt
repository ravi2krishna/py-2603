        -> Python Language Fundamentals 


    -> Python

        -> Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
        Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the 
        use of significant indentation. 
        Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.


        -> Python is a high-level programming language

            -> High Level Language means "Human Understandable" language (English)

            -> Python Code Looks Like English

                num1 = 1.5
                num2 = 6.3
                # Add two numbers
                sum = num1 + num2

        -> Low Level programming language

            -> Low Level Language means "Machine Understandable" language (Binary Bits i.e 001010)

            -> 01110000 01111001 01110100 01101000 01101111 01101110 -> python



        -> Python is a general-purpose programming language

            -> If we can build multiple types of Applications

                -> Desktop Applications ? -> Yes 

                -> Web Applications ? -> Yes 

                -> API's ? -> Yes 

                -> Automation Scripts ? -> Yes 


        -> Domain Specific programming language

            -> If we can build only Specific types of Applications

                -> SQL: Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language used to manage data, 
                especially in a relational database management system(RDBMS).

                -> Desktop Applications ? -> NO 

                -> Web Applications ? -> NO 

    -> Python design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the 
        use of significant indentation. 

        -> Code Readability

            Java Code
            ---------

                class Main {

                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        
                        int first = 10;
                        int second = 20;

                        // add two numbers
                        int sum = first + second;
                        System.out.println(first + " + " + second + " = "  + sum);
                    }
                }

                class 
                public
                static
                void
                []
                ()
                {}
                ;

            
            Python Code
            -----------

                num1 = 1.5
                num2 = 6.3
                # Add two numbers
                sum = num1 + num2
                print(sum)

        -> indentation

            -> indentation refers to code Structuring 

            -> In Python we use "spaces" for indentation

            -> ABC Language - https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTele9NP843yKTjtsSbAFoDgEUvS28n14OcgBXzPl4v0pBF49910b1s5B8XZS1kssqRQsrIC8KZMRWATvOoxR2PY7hvCCxQnJH6LkT0lw&s=10


    -> Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.        

        -> Dynamically type-checked Language (python)

            -> We have a concept called "Data Types"

                -> Data Types: Categorization Of Data 

                    -> text, whole numbers, decimal numbers etc 

            -> NOTE: Dynamically Type checked means, we don't we need to "explicitly" 
            specify Data Type

                -> product = "iphone 17"
                -> price = 135000
                -> rating = 4.5 
                -> etc 

        -> Static type-checked Language (java)

            -> NOTE: Static Type checked means, we "MUST" to "explicitly" specify Data Type

                -> String product = "iphone 17";
                -> int price = 135000;
                -> double rating = 4.5; 
                -> etc 

    -> Python is  garbage-collected

        -> Automatically remove "Unused" data 

            -> Python Automatically Cleans Up Unused Data from Memory / RAM 

                    product = "iphone 17"
                    price = 135000
                    rating = 4.5 
                    print(product)
                    print(price)

                -> Python cleans up rating memory as it's never used in program 


20th Jan 2026
===============

    -> Python is an "Interpreted" Language

        -> An Interpreted Language executes the code "line by line" 

    -> "Compiled" Language

        -> A Compiled Language translates the code into Machine Code then executes all the code at once 

        -> Java is an Compiled Language

        -> NOTE: Performance wise "Compiled" Languages are "FASTER"

    
    -> Considering above point, still why python ?

        -> Easy To Understand / Easy Readability / Dynamic Typed (Developer Perspective)

        -> Development SPEED 

        -> Python is best PROTO TYPE Language as we can develop Applications Much Faster 

    
    -> Programming Paradigms 

        -> A programming paradigm is a relatively high-level way to conceptualize 
        and structure the implementation of a computer program.

        -> Problem: How To Reach Institute ?

            -> Solution 1: I'll come by Walk 
            -> Solution 1: I'll come by Bike
            -> Solution 1: I'll come by Car  

        -> We have Two Popular Types 

            -> Imperative Approach 

                -> Focus is on "HOW TO DO" 

                -> Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

            -> Declarative Approach 

                -> Focus is on "WHAT TO DO" 

                -> Functional Oriented Programming

    -> NOTE: Python uses multi paradigm approach i.e we use 
    Imperative Approach & Declarative Approach 

    -> Imperative Code With Python 

                def get_user_emails(users):
                        emails = []  # Step-by-step building the result

                        for i in range(len(users)):         # Loop manually
                            user = users[i]                 # Fetch each user

                            if user.get("email") is not None:   # Check condition manually
                                emails.append(user["email"])    # Manually add to list

                        return emails


                    # Sample users list
                    users = [
                        {"name": "Mike", "email": "mike@gmail.com"},
                        {"name": "John", "email": None},
                        {"name": "Sara", "email": "sara@gmail.com"}
                    ]

                    print(get_user_emails(users))
        

    -> Declarative Code With Python 

                emails = [u["email"] for u in users if u["email"] is not None]


    -> Key Features Of Python / Why Python ?

        -> Simplicity & Easy Readability

            -> IDE: Integrated Development Environment 

                -> Tool for writing code (syntax highlight, auto code completion, install plugins etc)

                -> Visual Studio Code (VS Code)   

    -> Python Setup 

        -> open command prompt (windows)

            -> python --version

            -> python3 --version 

    -> Where To Write Python Code ?

        -> Command Line Mode (not recommended)

            -> We write the code in command prompt(win) / terminal(mac)

            -> Temporary, once we close the session all code is reset 

        -> Script Mode (recommended)

            -> We write the code in files using IDE i.e Visual Studio Code 

            -> Permanent, stored on disk 

21st Jan 2026
===============

    -> How To Write Python Code ?

        -> Any programming language has "syntax" (Rules)

        -> Comparing programming language with english language

            -> i taking class now today at 11:15 AM now (incorrect)

            -> i'm taking class today at 11:15 AM (correct)

        -> Learn English 

            -> English has 26 Alphabets (abcd........z)

            -> Using these Alphabets, we learn to form words and complex sentences over time 

        -> Learn Python 

            -> Python has 35 "keywords" (which are equivalent to english Alphabets)

            -> Using these keywords we form statements using some syntax/rules over time 

            -> List Of Python keywords

                -> https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords

                    False      await      else       import     pass
                    None       break      except     in         raise
                    True       class      finally    is         return
                    and        continue   for        lambda     try
                    as         def        from       nonlocal   while
                    assert     del        global     not        with
                    async      elif       if         or         yield
            
            -> NOTE: All the above keywords hold some special meaning to Python Interpreter

    
    -> Python Rules / Syntax 

        -> Any python file we write, should have extension as .py 

        -> Python ignores lines that start with # 

        -> Comments are represented using # 

        -> When working with numeric values(1,2,10,-1,3.5,5.5 etc)
        we can directly use print() with numerics 

        -> When working with text data, in python we call it as "String"

            -> Strings are supposed to be represented using ' ' or " " 

    -> Identifiers 

         -> An identifier is a "name" used to uniquely identify a piece of data 
            in python code 

            -> Variable 
            -> Function 
            -> Class 
            -> Object 
            -> etc 

        -> Identifiers Rules 

            -> Can Contain

                -> Letters (a-z A-Z)
                -> Digits (0-9)
                -> Special Symbols ( _ Only underscore)

            -> Must Start With 

                -> A letter or _ (underscore)

        -> NOTE: Always use proper way of naming identifiers    
    
    
    -> Variables 

        -> Variable is a named storage location in computers memory (RAM)
            that holds some value or data 

        -> Computer -> RAM -> Variables 

        -> Variable Syntax 

            -> variable_name = value 

                -> variable_name should follow identifier rules 
                -> = called as assignment operator 
                -> value is data you want to store 

                    -> data = 10 (valid)
                    -> data = ten (invalid)
                    -> data = "ten" (valid)

            -> Variables Allow You To 

                -> Assign Data (Store Data)

                -> Retrieve Data (Get Data)

                -> Manipulate Data (Change Data If Required)
        
        -> Combine Variables With Our Custom Statements 

            -> Concatenation: Joining Strings using + operator 

            -> When Combining String With other data types like int, float etc use , operator

        -> To Know the type of data / value 

            -> use type() function 


22nd Jan 2026
===============

    -> You can check the memory address assigned to data using 

        -> id(): gives memory address

    -> Memory Model In Python 

        -> If a value is already present in memory, python will not create 
        a new memory block for the same value.

    
    -> Manipulate Data (Change Data If Required) Using "Operators"

    -> Operators

        -> Operators are special "Symbols" and "keywords", which Performs 
        Operations on Variables and their Values 

        -> There are different types of operators, to deal with different types of data 

        -> Arithmetic Operators

            -> To Perform Mathematical Calculations 

            -> + - * / % 
            -> // - floor division (same as division but rounds off result)
            -> ** - Exponentiation (used to Calculate powers)

        -> Compound Assignment Operators

            -> Assignment Operator is = (used for assigning a value to Variable)

            -> Compound Assignment Operators Combine Arithmetic Operators 
                with Assignment Operators for "short hand code" (concise code)

                -> x = 10
                -> x = x + 5 (long form)
                -> x = x * 5 (long form)

                -> x += 5 (short form)
                -> x *= 5 (short form)

            -> In Other Programming Languages we got Increment & Decrement Operators

                -> Increment (++)
                -> Decrement (--)

                -> NOTE: Above are not supported in python 

        -> Comparison Operators

            -> Comparison Operators are used for Comparing Values
                and result is in boolean type (True/False)

                -> Especially Used In Conditional Checks 

                -> ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= 
        
        -> Logical Operators

            -> For Performing Logical Operations 

            -> Used to check multiple conditions 
                and result is in boolean type (True/False)

            -> and : if both conditions are True, then only result is True, otherwise False 
            -> or : if one of the conditions is True, then result is True, otherwise False 
            -> not : negates the result, if true then false and vice versa 

                            X       Y       X and Y    X or Y    not X    not Y
                            T       T           T         T         F       F
                            T       F           F         T         F       T
                            F       T           F         T         T       F
                            F       F           F         F         T       T 
        
        -> Membership Operators

            -> Used for checking if an object in in the given sequence 

                -> in : return True, if given object is in sequence

                -> not in : return True, if given object is not in sequence

            -> NOTE: How do i know if the object is sequence/iterable or not ?

                -> we use dir() - tells what kind of operations can be performed 

                    -> if __iter___ is found then it's iterable
