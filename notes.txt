        -> Python Language Fundamentals 


    -> Python

        -> Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
        Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the 
        use of significant indentation. 
        Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.


        -> Python is a high-level programming language

            -> High Level Language means "Human Understandable" language (English)

            -> Python Code Looks Like English

                num1 = 1.5
                num2 = 6.3
                # Add two numbers
                sum = num1 + num2

        -> Low Level programming language

            -> Low Level Language means "Machine Understandable" language (Binary Bits i.e 001010)

            -> 01110000 01111001 01110100 01101000 01101111 01101110 -> python



        -> Python is a general-purpose programming language

            -> If we can build multiple types of Applications

                -> Desktop Applications ? -> Yes 

                -> Web Applications ? -> Yes 

                -> API's ? -> Yes 

                -> Automation Scripts ? -> Yes 


        -> Domain Specific programming language

            -> If we can build only Specific types of Applications

                -> SQL: Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language used to manage data, 
                especially in a relational database management system(RDBMS).

                -> Desktop Applications ? -> NO 

                -> Web Applications ? -> NO 

    -> Python design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the 
        use of significant indentation. 

        -> Code Readability

            Java Code
            ---------

                class Main {

                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        
                        int first = 10;
                        int second = 20;

                        // add two numbers
                        int sum = first + second;
                        System.out.println(first + " + " + second + " = "  + sum);
                    }
                }

                class 
                public
                static
                void
                []
                ()
                {}
                ;

            
            Python Code
            -----------

                num1 = 1.5
                num2 = 6.3
                # Add two numbers
                sum = num1 + num2
                print(sum)

        -> indentation

            -> indentation refers to code Structuring 

            -> In Python we use "spaces" for indentation

            -> ABC Language - https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTele9NP843yKTjtsSbAFoDgEUvS28n14OcgBXzPl4v0pBF49910b1s5B8XZS1kssqRQsrIC8KZMRWATvOoxR2PY7hvCCxQnJH6LkT0lw&s=10


    -> Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.        

        -> Dynamically type-checked Language (python)

            -> We have a concept called "Data Types"

                -> Data Types: Categorization Of Data 

                    -> text, whole numbers, decimal numbers etc 

            -> NOTE: Dynamically Type checked means, we don't we need to "explicitly" 
            specify Data Type

                -> product = "iphone 17"
                -> price = 135000
                -> rating = 4.5 
                -> etc 

        -> Static type-checked Language (java)

            -> NOTE: Static Type checked means, we "MUST" to "explicitly" specify Data Type

                -> String product = "iphone 17";
                -> int price = 135000;
                -> double rating = 4.5; 
                -> etc 

    -> Python is  garbage-collected

        -> Automatically remove "Unused" data 

            -> Python Automatically Cleans Up Unused Data from Memory / RAM 

                    product = "iphone 17"
                    price = 135000
                    rating = 4.5 
                    print(product)
                    print(price)

                -> Python cleans up rating memory as it's never used in program 


20th Jan 2026
===============

    -> Python is an "Interpreted" Language

        -> An Interpreted Language executes the code "line by line" 

    -> "Compiled" Language

        -> A Compiled Language translates the code into Machine Code then executes all the code at once 

        -> Java is an Compiled Language

        -> NOTE: Performance wise "Compiled" Languages are "FASTER"

    
    -> Considering above point, still why python ?

        -> Easy To Understand / Easy Readability / Dynamic Typed (Developer Perspective)

        -> Development SPEED 

        -> Python is best PROTO TYPE Language as we can develop Applications Much Faster 

    
    -> Programming Paradigms 

        -> A programming paradigm is a relatively high-level way to conceptualize 
        and structure the implementation of a computer program.

        -> Problem: How To Reach Institute ?

            -> Solution 1: I'll come by Walk 
            -> Solution 1: I'll come by Bike
            -> Solution 1: I'll come by Car  

        -> We have Two Popular Types 

            -> Imperative Approach 

                -> Focus is on "HOW TO DO" 

                -> Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

            -> Declarative Approach 

                -> Focus is on "WHAT TO DO" 

                -> Functional Oriented Programming

    -> NOTE: Python uses multi paradigm approach i.e we use 
    Imperative Approach & Declarative Approach 

    -> Imperative Code With Python 

                def get_user_emails(users):
                        emails = []  # Step-by-step building the result

                        for i in range(len(users)):         # Loop manually
                            user = users[i]                 # Fetch each user

                            if user.get("email") is not None:   # Check condition manually
                                emails.append(user["email"])    # Manually add to list

                        return emails


                    # Sample users list
                    users = [
                        {"name": "Mike", "email": "mike@gmail.com"},
                        {"name": "John", "email": None},
                        {"name": "Sara", "email": "sara@gmail.com"}
                    ]

                    print(get_user_emails(users))
        

    -> Declarative Code With Python 

                emails = [u["email"] for u in users if u["email"] is not None]


    -> Key Features Of Python / Why Python ?

        -> Simplicity & Easy Readability

            -> IDE: Integrated Development Environment 

                -> Tool for writing code (syntax highlight, auto code completion, install plugins etc)

                -> Visual Studio Code (VS Code)   

    -> Python Setup 

        -> open command prompt (windows)

            -> python --version 
            -> if not found download exe and install

            -> python3 --version 

    -> Where To Write Python Code ?

        -> Command Line Mode (not recommended)

            -> We write the code in command prompt(win) / terminal(mac)

            -> Temporary, once we close the session all code is reset 

        -> Script Mode (recommended)

            -> We write the code in files using IDE i.e Visual Studio Code 

            -> Permanent, stored on disk 

21st Jan 2026
===============

    -> How To Write Python Code ?

        -> Any programming language has "syntax" (Rules)

        -> Comparing programming language with english language

            -> i taking class now today at 11:15 AM now (incorrect)

            -> i'm taking class today at 11:15 AM (correct)

        -> Learn English 

            -> English has 26 Alphabets (abcd........z)

            -> Using these Alphabets, we learn to form words and complex sentences over time 

        -> Learn Python 

            -> Python has 35 "keywords" (which are equivalent to english Alphabets)

            -> Using these keywords we form statements using some syntax/rules over time 

            -> List Of Python keywords

                -> https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords

                    False      await      else       import     pass
                    None       break      except     in         raise
                    True       class      finally    is         return
                    and        continue   for        lambda     try
                    as         def        from       nonlocal   while
                    assert     del        global     not        with
                    async      elif       if         or         yield
            
            -> NOTE: All the above keywords hold some special meaning to Python Interpreter

    
    -> Python Rules / Syntax 

        -> Any python file we write, should have extension as .py 

        -> Python ignores lines that start with # 

        -> Comments are represented using # 

        -> When working with numeric values(1,2,10,-1,3.5,5.5 etc)
        we can directly use print() with numerics 

        -> When working with text data, in python we call it as "String"

            -> Strings are supposed to be represented using ' ' or " " 

    -> Identifiers 

         -> An identifier is a "name" used to uniquely identify a piece of data 
            in python code 

            -> Variable 
            -> Function 
            -> Class 
            -> Object 
            -> etc 

        -> Identifiers Rules 

            -> Can Contain

                -> Letters (a-z A-Z)
                -> Digits (0-9)
                -> Special Symbols ( _ Only underscore)

            -> Must Start With 

                -> A letter or _ (underscore)

        -> NOTE: Always use proper way of naming identifiers    
    
    
    -> Variables 

        -> Variable is a named storage location in computers memory (RAM)
            that holds some value or data 

        -> Computer -> RAM -> Variables 

        -> Variable Syntax 

            -> variable_name = value 

                -> variable_name should follow identifier rules 
                -> = called as assignment operator 
                -> value is data you want to store 

                    -> data = 10 (valid)
                    -> data = ten (invalid)
                    -> data = "ten" (valid)

            -> Variables Allow You To 

                -> Assign Data (Store Data)

                -> Retrieve Data (Get Data)

                -> Manipulate Data (Change Data If Required)
        
        -> Combine Variables With Our Custom Statements 

            -> Concatenation: Joining Strings using + operator 

            -> When Combining String With other data types like int, float etc use , operator

        -> To Know the type of data / value 

            -> use type() function 


22nd Jan 2026
===============

    -> You can check the memory address assigned to data using 

        -> id(): gives memory address

    -> Memory Model In Python 

        -> If a value is already present in memory, python will not create 
        a new memory block for the same value.

    
    -> Manipulate Data (Change Data If Required) Using "Operators"

    -> Operators

        -> Operators are special "Symbols" and "keywords", which Performs 
        Operations on Variables and their Values 

        -> There are different types of operators, to deal with different types of data 

        -> Arithmetic Operators

            -> To Perform Mathematical Calculations 

            -> + - * / % 
            -> // - floor division (same as division but rounds off result)
            -> ** - Exponentiation (used to Calculate powers)

        -> Compound Assignment Operators

            -> Assignment Operator is = (used for assigning a value to Variable)

            -> Compound Assignment Operators Combine Arithmetic Operators 
                with Assignment Operators for "short hand code" (concise code)

                -> x = 10
                -> x = x + 5 (long form)
                -> x = x * 5 (long form)

                -> x += 5 (short form)
                -> x *= 5 (short form)

            -> In Other Programming Languages we got Increment & Decrement Operators

                -> Increment (++)
                -> Decrement (--)

                -> NOTE: Above are not supported in python 

        -> Comparison Operators

            -> Comparison Operators are used for Comparing Values
                and result is in boolean type (True/False)

                -> Especially Used In Conditional Checks 

                -> ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= 
        
        -> Logical Operators

            -> For Performing Logical Operations 

            -> Used to check multiple conditions 
                and result is in boolean type (True/False)

            -> and : if both conditions are True, then only result is True, otherwise False 
            -> or : if one of the conditions is True, then result is True, otherwise False 
            -> not : negates the result, if true then false and vice versa 

                            X       Y       X and Y    X or Y    not X    not Y
                            T       T           T         T         F       F
                            T       F           F         T         F       T
                            F       T           F         T         T       F
                            F       F           F         F         T       T 
        
        -> Membership Operators

            -> Used for checking if an object in in the given sequence 

                -> in : return True, if given object is in sequence

                -> not in : return True, if given object is not in sequence

            -> NOTE: How do i know if the object is sequence/iterable or not ?

                -> we use dir() - tells what kind of operations can be performed 

                    -> if __iter___ is found then it's iterable


23rd Jan 2026
===============

    -> Identity Operators

        -> Used to check if objects are same 

        -> is : return True, if objects are same  

        -> is not : return True, if objects are not same  

        -> NOTE: 
            
                -> (Equality operator ==): Compares the values of two objects. 
                It returns True if their contents are the same, 
                regardless of where they are stored in memory.

                -> is (Identity operator): Compares the identity (memory address) of two objects. 
                It returns True only if both variables refer to the exact same object in memory. 

    -> Bitwise Operators

        -> Used in Low Level Programming(0101010101)

            -> & - if both bits are 1, then result is 1 
            -> | - if one of the bits is 1, then result is 1 
            -> etc 

    
    -> Data Types 

        -> Data Types are Categorization that defines, what kind of data a variable can hold 

    -> Numeric Types

        -> int : 1,2,3,0,-1,-2 etc 
        
        -> float : 3.5, 1.5, 2.1 1.0 etc 

        -> complex :

            -> a + ib in math (i - imaginary)

            -> a + bj in python 

    -> Boolean Type

        -> bool : Represents True / False (case sensitive)

    -> None Type

        -> NoneType : Represents nothing i.e absence of value 

    -> String Type 

        -> str : String is a sequence of characters enclosed in ' ' or " "

    
    -> Simple Data Types: Holds "Single Value" in a single variable

    -> Complex Data Types: Holds "Multiple Values" in a single variable

    
    -> List: List is complex data type i.e it holds multiple values represented using []

    -> Tuple: Tuple is complex data type i.e it holds multiple values represented using ()

    -> Set: Set is complex data type i.e it holds multiple values represented using {}

    -> Frozenset: Frozenset is complex data type i.e it holds multiple values represented 
    using frozenset class 

    -> Dictionary (Map Type): Dictionary is complex data type i.e it holds multiple key values 
    represented using {}

    -> Control Structures / Control Statements 

        -> Control Structures helps you determine the flow of execution 
        in a python program, allowing you to "make decisions" and "repeat tasks".

    -> Python has given three types of Control Structures

        -> Conditional Structures / Statements (Decision Making Statements)

        -> Looping Structures / Statements (Iteration Statements)

        -> Branching Structures / Statements (Jump Statements)

    -> NOTE: To Work with above Control Structures, "indentation" knowledge is must

    -> Indentation

        -> Indentation in Python is a fundamental and mandatory aspect of its "syntax", 
            used to define the structure and hierarchy of "code blocks". 
            Unlike many other programming languages that use curly braces or keywords 
            to delineate blocks, Python relies entirely on "consistent" indentation.

        -> Using space as indentation (using spaces correctly is important)

        -> Python allows for any consistent number of spaces or 
            a single tab(4 spaces) for indentation, 
            the widely accepted and recommended standard.

                -> At least one space but recommended is 4 space i.e tab 

    
    -> Conditional Structures / Statements (Decision Making Statements)

        -> Used to run a "block of code" based on a condition result 

        -> if 
                -> runs a block of code, if the condition is True 

                    -> syntax 
                        if condition:
                            statements 
        
        -> if else 

                -> runs a block of code, if the condition is True 
                    runs another block of code, if the condition is False 

                    -> syntax 
                        if condition:
                            statements
                        else:
                            statements
            
        -> NOTE: input() function reads input from user and stores the value as String 

        -> Interpolation 

                -> Interpolation technique replaces, place holders with actual values dynamically

                -> Using "f-strings" (Formatted String Literals)

                    -> we use f with print and {} as place holders 

        
        -> The ternary operator in Python, also known as a "conditional expression", 
            provides a concise way(short hand code) to write an 
            if-else statement on a single line.
             
            -> NOTE: It evaluates a condition and returns one of two values 
            based on whether the condition is true or false.

            -> syntax 
                value_if_true if condition else value_if_false     


        -> elif ladder 

            -> elif is a keyword that stands for "else if" 

            -> It is used in conditional statements to check "multiple conditions"
                sequentially after an initial if statement
            
            -> Syntax

                if condition:
                    statements
                elif condition:
                    statements
                elif condition:
                    statements
                elif condition:
                    statements
                elif condition:
                    statements
                else:
                    statements

27th Jan 2026
===============

    -> The match/case statement (introduced in Python 3.10) is used for 
    structural "pattern matching", providing a cleaner, more powerful 
    alternative to long if/elif chains. 

    -> In other programming languages we call it as switch-case 

    -> syntax 

            match expression:
                case pattern_1:
                    # code block 1    
                case pattern_2:
                    # code block 2
                case pattern_3:
                    # code block 3
                .
                .
                .
                case _:
                    # default code block

    -> Nested Conditionals 

        -> Nested conditions in Python involve placing an if or if/else statement 
        inside another if, elif, or else block.

        -> This allows the program to evaluate multiple criteria sequentially, 
        where the inner condition is only checked if the outer condition is true. 

    
    -> Looping Structures / Statements (Iteration Statements)

        -> Loops in Python are used to "repeatedly" execute a block of code 
        until a specific condition is met or for each item in a sequence.

        -> The two primary types of loops are "for" loops and "while" loops. 

        -> When you want to do a task multiple times, use loops 

        -> "while" loop

            -> while loops execute a block of code repeatedly 
            as long as a specified condition remains True

            -> syntax

                while condition:
                    statements 

            -> NOTE: We use while generally, when we don't know number of
            Iterations/Repetitions in advance

        -> "for" loop

            -> for loop is used to iterate over a sequence 
                (like a list, tuple, string, or range) 

            -> NOTE: For loop executes a block of code once for each item in the sequence. 

            -> syntax 

                for variable in sequence:
                    statement

            -> NOTE: We use for generally, when we know number of
            Iterations/Repetitions in advance

        
        -> range() 

                -> The range() function in Python generates an immutable sequence of numbers. 
                It is commonly used for iterating a specific number of times in for loops. 

                -> range(start, stop, step): This form generates a sequence of numbers starting 
                from start (inclusive) up to, but not including, the stop value, 
                with an increment of step. The step can be positive or negative.

                    range(start, stop, step)
                        -> start default is 0 (included) (inclusive)
                        -> stop at this value (excluded) (exclusive)
                        -> step is increment (default step is 1)


28th Jan 2026
===============

    -> Nested Loops 

        -> A nested loop in Python is a "loop placed inside the body of another loop". 
        This structure is used to handle multidimensional data (like grids or lists within lists), 
        generate patterns, and perform actions that require "multiple layers of iteration". 

        -> Loops inside Loops 

    
    -> Branching Structures / Statements (Jump Statements)

        -> Used within loops, these statements also control the flow of execution, 
        allowing you to exit a loop early (break) or skip the current iteration (continue). 

            -> break : help you exit the loops 

            -> continue : help you skip the current iteration 

            -> pass : acts as a placeholder, does nothing


29th Jan 2026
===============

    -> Strings 

        -> Strings are one of the "Most Widely Used Datatype" in any programming language 

            -> https://www.instagram.com/

            -> https://www.instagram.com/accounts/emailsignup/?next=

            -> NOTE: Most of the inputs we process from web pages of an Application are Strings 

        -> In Python, a string is a "sequence of characters", used to represent text. 

        -> Strings are widely used for handling and manipulating textual information.

        -> Syntax for representing strings 

            -> Strings can be enclosed in '' or " " or ''' ''' or """ """

                -> Single Line Strings: Use '' or " "

                -> Multi Line Strings: Use ''' ''' or """ """

        -> Rules When Defining Strings 

            -> When you use single quote in a string, enclose them in double quotes 
            -> When you use double quote in a string, enclose them in single quotes 
            -> When you use both single quote and double quote in a string, 
                enclose them in triple quotes 


    -> Access Strings 

        -> Indexing

            -> String indexing in Python allows access to "individual characters within a string" 
            using their "position", known as the "index".

            -> Python uses zero-based indexing, meaning the first character is at index 0, 
            the second at index 1, and so on.

                -> print(string[index])

            -> Positive Indexing:
            Starts from the beginning of the string.
            The index of the first character is 0.
        
            -> Negative Indexing:
            Starts from the end of the string.
            The index of the last character is -1.

            -> text = "python"

            0 1 2 3 4    5
            p y t h o    n 
           -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1

        -> NOTE: Accessing index out of range will cause Error 

   
   -> Slicing

        -> String slicing in Python is a method for extracting a portion (substring) 
        from a larger string. It utilizes the slice operator [] with specific 
        indices to define the desired segment.

        -> syntax 

            string[start:end:step]

                -> start (optional): The index where the slice begins (inclusive). 
                    If omitted, it defaults to 0 (the beginning of the string).
                -> end (optional): The index where the slice ends (exclusive). 
                    The character at this index is not included. 
                    If omitted, it defaults to the length of the string (the end of the string).
                -> step (optional): The increment between each index during slicing. 
                    If omitted, it defaults to 1. 
                    A negative step value can be used to slice in reverse.
            
            -> Earlier we used range()

                range(start,end,step)

    -> String Concatenation 

        -> Joining the strings using + operator

    -> Formatted String Literals (f-strings)

        -> Using Interpolation {} with f 

    -> String Repetition 

        -> Repeat strings using "*" operator

    -> String Immutability 

        -> Strings are Immutable in nature (Immutable == cannot be changed/modified)


30th Jan 2026
===============

    -> String Methods 

        -> String methods in Python are built-in functions/methods that operate on 
        string objects, allowing for various manipulations, transformations, and checks. 
        
        -> It is important to note that strings in Python are immutable, 
        meaning these methods do not modify the original string but 
        instead return a new string with the applied changes.
    
    -> https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods

    -> Functional Programming 

        -> In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm 
        where programs are constructed by applying and composing "functions"

    -> Functions 

        -> In Python, a function is a named, "reusable block of code" that performs 
        a specific task, takes input (arguments), processes data, 
        and can return an output.

    
    -> Why Functions 

        ->  For writing modular, organized and efficient code. 

        -> Functions can break down complex problems into smaller and
        simpler manageable sub tasks for promoting code modularity. 

        -> Once defined a function, it can be "called multiple times", so that 
        we can achieve code reusability.

    -> Functions are defined using "def" keyword, followed by function name,
        parenthesis(which may contain parameters), and a colon:
        the code within the function is indented 

        -> syntax

            def function_name():
                statements

            def function_name(parameters):
                statements

        -> NOTE: calling function is must

            function_name()

        -> Python functions can be defined to accept "parameters" 
            which can act as placeholders for values that will be 
            passed into function when called. 
        
        -> Values passed to the function we call them as "arguments"

        -> We use parameters to make functions dynamic in nature 


    -> Based On "arguments" passed to functions, we got five types 

        -> Positional Arguments 

        -> Keywords Arguments 

        -> Default Arguments 

        -> Arbitrary Positional Arguments

===============

    -> Positional Arguments

        -> In Python, positional arguments are values passed to a function during 
        its call, where the assignment of these values to the function's parameters 
        is determined solely by their "order" (position) in the argument list. 
        
        -> The first argument in the function call is assigned to the first parameter 
        in the function definition, the second to the second, and so on. 

        -> Order Matters: If the order is incorrect, the function will receive the wrong values 
        for its intended parameters, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

    -> Keywords Arguments

        -> In Python, keyword arguments are a way to pass values to a function by explicitly 
        "naming the parameters" they correspond to, rather than relying on their position 
        in the argument list. 
        
        -> This offers several advantages, primarily in terms of code readability and flexibility.

    -> Default Arguments 

        -> In Python, default arguments allow you to define a function parameter 
            with a "pre-assigned" value. 
        
        -> If a caller does not provide an argument for that parameter during a function call, 
            the default value is automatically used. 
            If an argument is provided, it overrides the default.

        -> Placement Requirement: Default arguments must always be placed after 
            any non-default (positional) arguments in the function definition. 
            Attempting to place a non-default argument after a 
                default argument will result in a SyntaxError.

    
    -> Arbitrary Positional Arguments

        -> In Python, arbitrary positional arguments allow a function to accept 
            a variable/unknown number of non-keyword arguments. 
            This is achieved by placing an asterisk (*) before a parameter name 
                in the function definition. 
            
        -> This parameter will then collect all the extra positional arguments passed 
            to the function into a single tuple. 

    
    -> Arbitrary Keywords Arguments

        -> In Python, arbitrary keyword arguments allow a function to accept 
            a variable/unknown number of keyword arguments. 
            This is achieved by placing an asterisk (**) before a parameter name 
                in the function definition. 

        -> This parameter will be collected into a dictionary, where the names will be keys and 
            values will be dictionary values
