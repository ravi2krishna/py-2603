        -> Python Language Fundamentals 


    -> Python

        -> Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
        Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the 
        use of significant indentation. 
        Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.


        -> Python is a high-level programming language

            -> High Level Language means "Human Understandable" language (English)

            -> Python Code Looks Like English

                num1 = 1.5
                num2 = 6.3
                # Add two numbers
                sum = num1 + num2

        -> Low Level programming language

            -> Low Level Language means "Machine Understandable" language (Binary Bits i.e 001010)

            -> 01110000 01111001 01110100 01101000 01101111 01101110 -> python



        -> Python is a general-purpose programming language

            -> If we can build multiple types of Applications

                -> Desktop Applications ? -> Yes 

                -> Web Applications ? -> Yes 

                -> API's ? -> Yes 

                -> Automation Scripts ? -> Yes 


        -> Domain Specific programming language

            -> If we can build only Specific types of Applications

                -> SQL: Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language used to manage data, 
                especially in a relational database management system(RDBMS).

                -> Desktop Applications ? -> NO 

                -> Web Applications ? -> NO 

    -> Python design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the 
        use of significant indentation. 

        -> Code Readability

            Java Code
            ---------

                class Main {

                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        
                        int first = 10;
                        int second = 20;

                        // add two numbers
                        int sum = first + second;
                        System.out.println(first + " + " + second + " = "  + sum);
                    }
                }

                class 
                public
                static
                void
                []
                ()
                {}
                ;

            
            Python Code
            -----------

                num1 = 1.5
                num2 = 6.3
                # Add two numbers
                sum = num1 + num2
                print(sum)

        -> indentation

            -> indentation refers to code Structuring 

            -> In Python we use "spaces" for indentation

            -> ABC Language - https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTele9NP843yKTjtsSbAFoDgEUvS28n14OcgBXzPl4v0pBF49910b1s5B8XZS1kssqRQsrIC8KZMRWATvOoxR2PY7hvCCxQnJH6LkT0lw&s=10


    -> Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.        

        -> Dynamically type-checked Language (python)

            -> We have a concept called "Data Types"

                -> Data Types: Categorization Of Data 

                    -> text, whole numbers, decimal numbers etc 

            -> NOTE: Dynamically Type checked means, we don't we need to "explicitly" 
            specify Data Type

                -> product = "iphone 17"
                -> price = 135000
                -> rating = 4.5 
                -> etc 

        -> Static type-checked Language (java)

            -> NOTE: Static Type checked means, we "MUST" to "explicitly" specify Data Type

                -> String product = "iphone 17";
                -> int price = 135000;
                -> double rating = 4.5; 
                -> etc 

    -> Python is  garbage-collected

        -> Automatically remove "Unused" data 

            -> Python Automatically Cleans Up Unused Data from Memory / RAM 

                    product = "iphone 17"
                    price = 135000
                    rating = 4.5 
                    print(product)
                    print(price)

                -> Python cleans up rating memory as it's never used in program
